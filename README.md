# Dr_Agro_MEAN_STACK-

Here I have tried to build a FULLSTACK project. 
I have used MEAN STACK here where Angular is for frontend, Node.js, Express.js for backend & MongoDB for Database.
For building up the entire project, I took help from different tutorials on YouTube along with different blog posts. I have also mentioned them below.
