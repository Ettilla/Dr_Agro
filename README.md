# Plant_Doctor_MEAN_Stack_Project

Here I have tried to build a FULLSTACK project. 
I have used MEAN STACK for this purpose, where Angular is for frontend, Node.js, Express.js for backend & MongoDB for Database. MongoDB Atlas database service is used here.
For building up the entire project, I took help from different tutorials on YouTube along with different blog posts. I have also mentioned them below.


## Project Building Blocks
